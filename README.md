## Comprehensive Sysadmin Lab Project

Welcome to my Comprehensive Sysadmin Lab

This project covers setting up Active Directory, automating tasks with PowerShell, and implementing best practices for system administration. I created this with emphasis on using Powershell and Bash for my own learning and practice. 

Please note: I am a learner myself and by no means an expert. There may be better ways to achieve the same results. 

## Prerequisites
- Virtual Environment: Hyper-V, VMware, or VirtualBox (I am using Virtual Box, but any VE will work)
- Software: Windows Server ISO (I am using 2019), Windows 11 ISO, Linux ISO (CentOS Stream 9, any distro will work but note some commands may be different), Docker and Ansible.

Follow the steps in the respective folders to complete the setup.
